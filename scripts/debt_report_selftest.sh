#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/debt_report_selftest.sh — fixture test for scripts/lib/debt_report.py.
#
# WHY
#   The report always exits 0 (advisory) — see scripts/debt_report.sh — so its
#   detection power is not in an exit code. Each case below asserts that a
#   specific fact actually appears (or is absent) in the printed text, rather
#   than trusting that the tool ran without checking what it found.
#
# HOW
#   scripts/fixtures/debt_report/base/ is a synthetic scan root: a twin file
#   pair, a same-naming-shape pair with unrelated bodies, the six speculative
#   round-loop drivers, and one doc over the size threshold plus one under it.
#   The add/remove-ratio case needs real git history, which the base fixture
#   does not have on its own (it is a subtree of this repo's working copy) —
#   it builds its own throwaway two-commit, one-tag repo in a temp dir instead.
#
# Exit 0 = every case found what it was supposed to. Exit 1 = at least one did not.
